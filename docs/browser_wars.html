            <h1>Netscape vs. Microsoft:</h1>
            <p>
                Let’s talk about the “Browser Wars.” They kicked off in the mid-90s, at a time when the world was just starting to come online.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;
                <h3>Netscape:</h3>
                Netscape had a pretty meteoric rise to the top of the web world. The company began pretty soon after software engineer Marc Andreessen graduated from the University of Illinois in 1994. So not long after he left Illinois, Andreessen was contacted by Jim Clark, a legend in the Silicon Valley area. Clark and Andreessen met a few times, and decided that a top of the line commercial browser was exactly what the market needed. By the end of 1994, they had already delivered a first step. Originally slated to be called Mosaic, the browser they released to the world became known as Netscape Navigator.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h3>Netscape Goes Public:</h3>
            For a company of Netscape’s size, their IPO went incredibly well. And that’s when Netscape got their first real competition from the goliath they knew would eventually come around: Microsoft. Bill Gates had notoriously stomped out adversaries in the past without a second thought. And already, Netscape had begun to consult an anti-trust lawyer to prepare against a possible assault.
            A few Microsoft engineers got together to start working on a new browser. And that’s why a few of them ended up at a meeting at Netscape.
            Over the years, this meeting has become the stuff of legends, primarily because there are two completely different versions of how it went down. In Microsoft’s version, the meeting went off without a hitch. In a long, but productive exchange, the two companies shared ideas and visions for the future.
            In Netscape’s version, things are quite a bit different. Microsoft came to them with an ultimatum. Join up or move out of the way. Microsoft offered Netscape a meager sum for their browsers code base. When the team refused, employees from Microsoft threatened to eliminate them from the market by any means necessary. As Netscape’s success grew, Microsoft got their own browser ready.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h3>Internet Explorer: </h3>
            As Netscape’s success grew, Microsoft got their own browser ready. It was called Internet Explorer. And
            version 1 was released fifteen days after Netscape’s IPO. For the next few years, Netscape and Microsoft
            waged war. One update after the other, Netscape and Microsoft fought each other head to head. Then, with the
            release of Internet Explorer 3.0, Microsoft dropped the hammer. They included this version, for free,
            bundled right into the Windows ’95 operating system. All at once, Netscape’s pricing model completely fell
            apart.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h3>The end of a War: </h3>
            Netscape continued to innovate, but they knew they couldn’t keep up. So, in January of 1998, they open
            sourced their browser, and began giving it away for free. In November of 1998, Netscape was sold to AOL for
            $4.2 billion. Eventually, Microsoft wrestled almost complete control over the market.
