            <h1>The Invention of the Internet:</h1>
            <p>
                The internet is an application of computers that connects millions of computer users. The history of the
                internet dates back to the invention of the modern computers. The invention of internet was commenced by
                the military as an experimental network in early nineteen sixties, then later commercialized for the
                public.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>The Development of Internet:</h4>
            The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States established a research program in
            1973, to explore technologies and techniques for connecting different types of packet network. The study was
            expanded to various agencies of the government and later to the higher learning institution. This study
            resulted to development of networking system which was referred to as the “Internet.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The invention of the Internet, along with the field of computer networking, was derived from the
                invention of the telephone network. Unlike the telephone network, the Internet uses packet switching.
                Packet switching was invented by three different independent research groups around the world. MIT
                graduate student Leonard Kleinrock, one of the first people to invent packet switching, was also the
                first person to publish work on packet switching. The work done at MIT, Rand and NPL helped lay the
                foundation of today’s Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1990s, the whole world started to change more drastically technological wise and the Internet
                began to affect people. The number of end systems connected to the Internet reached one million. One of
                the most important events that happened in the 1990s was the invention of the World Wide Web (WWW). The
                first Web was started in November 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee. With the start of WWW and browsers to surf
                the Internet, the commercialization emerged and has change the world tremendously, especially, with the
                development of the GUI browsers, such as, Mosaic Communications by Marc Andreesen and Jim Clark, which
                were later called Netscape Communications Corporations, and their opponent Microsoft Explorer.
